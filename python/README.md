## Instructions

- Compile the C part. `cd ../src` and then `make`.
- Set the env variable: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/vendor/build`
- Make a python3 virtualenv, activate it and `pip install cffi` there.
- Run `python ./setup.py install` from python folder to install the library. 
- Run `python ./dc_test.py` from the python folder to run the tests.

## Using the python library

#### Example usage
```python
  from datachannel import DataChannel
  import time

  # Override the callbacks
  class Peer(DataChannel):
      def onOpen(self, channel):
          print("Data Channel opened")
      def onMessage(self, message):
          print("Message received: ", message)
      def onClose(self, channel):
          print("Data Channel closed")
      def onChannel(self, peer, channel):
          print("Channel created")
      def onCandidate(self, peer, candidate):
          print("ICE Candidates found: ", candidate)
      def onConnect(self, peer):
          print("Peer connection established")

  # Create two peers.
  peerA = Peer()
  peerB = Peer()

  offerSDP_A = peerA.generate_offer_sdp() # PeerA's "offer"
  candidateSDP_A = peerA.generate_local_candidate()
  candidateSDP_B = peerB.generate_local_candidate()

  offerSDP_B = peerB.parse_offer_sdp(offerSDP_A) # B is accepting A's offer and generates new offer SDP
  peerA.parse_offer_sdp(offerSDP_B) # This new offer SDP generated by B is to be parsed by A

  # Each peer should parse each other's candidate SDPs
  if (peerA.parse_candidates(candidateSDP_B) and peerB.parse_candidates(candidateSDP_A)):
      # Both peers would have established a peer connection and subsequently a data channel by now
      time.sleep(7)
      peerA.send_message("test") # Or peerB can do the same

```

#### Requirements

- Python 3
- CFFI >= v1.6
